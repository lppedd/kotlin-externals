/**
 * The filesystem provider defines what the editor needs to read, write, discover,
 * and to manage files and folders. It allows extensions to serve files from remote places,
 * like ftp-servers, and to seamlessly integrate those into the editor.
 *
 * - *Note 1:* The filesystem provider API works with [Uri]s and assumes hierarchical
 *   paths, e.g. `foo:/my/path` is a child of `foo:/my/` and a parent of `foo:/my/path/deeper`.
 *
 * - *Note 2:* There is an activation event `onFileSystem:<scheme>` that fires when a file
 *   or folder is being accessed.
 *
 * - *Note 3:* The word 'file' is often used to denote all kinds ([FileType]) of files, e.g.
 *   folders, symbolic links, and regular files.

   *
   * *Note:* It is important that the metadata of the file that changed provides an
   * updated `mtime` that advanced from the previous value in the [FileStat] and a
   * correct `size` value. Otherwise there may be optimizations in place that will not show

   * be watched for file changes as well. With `recursive: false`, only changes to the
   * files that are direct children of the folder should trigger an event.
   *
   * The `excludes` array is used to indicate paths that should be excluded from file
   * watching. It is typically derived from the `files.watcherExclude` setting that
   * is configurable by the user. Each entry can be be:
   * - the absolute path to exclude
   * - a relative path to exclude (for example `build/output`)
   * - a simple glob pattern (for example `**â€‹/build`, `output&#47;**`)
